# LineCloser
Unofficial Keras implementation of Joint Gap Detection and Inpainting of Line Drawings.

## Overview
Joint gap for line-drawings. Model1 uses network from the paper. For stable training, BN was added for all Conv2D. Model2 uses common network for inpaint. Training code will be uploaded soon.

## Dependencies
* Keras2 (Tensorflow backend)
* OpenCV3

## Usage
1. Set up directories.

2. Download the model from release and put it in the same folder with code.

3. Run `predict.py` for prediction.
